# 👋🏼 Hello World! I'm Siem - a Dutch Web Developer

<p>
  I'm <strong>Siem</strong>, an 19-year-old software development student from the Netherlands, currently studying at <strong>Summa College</strong> in Eindhoven. 
  I’m passionate about web development, design, and discovering how technology works.
</p>

## 💻 What I Do

<p>
  I build both websites and desktop applications — handling both the frontend and backend. 
  Through real-world projects for companies and schools, I’ve gained valuable experience and sharpened my problem-solving skills.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy exploring new tools, understanding systems, and fixing bugs when things go wrong. 
  I’m always looking to improve by taking on challenging projects, and I love participating in hackathons whenever I get the chance.
</p>

## 📸 Photography

<p>
  When I’m not coding, I’m often out with my camera. I enjoy photographing landscapes, animals, and cars.
  What started as a curiosity has grown into a serious hobby — now shooting mostly with my Canon EOS 60D.
  Photography helps me slow down and appreciate the world around me.
